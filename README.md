Early efforts to convert [snorkel](http://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/) output to [PubAnnotation](http://pubannotation.org) format quickly implemented during the [BLAH3 Hackathon](http://blah3.linkedannotation.org).

snorkel is a framework to simplify the implementation of AI modules to learn (_unsupervised_) from unlabeled data.

PubAnnotation is a repository of biomedical annotations.

This repository contains, so far, a **Python 3** converter function from snorkel-derived files to PubAnnotation format. The input files were somehow tweaked by Juan M. Banda, therefore may not fully represent the exact snorkel format yet.

Future changes are expected.
